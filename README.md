# Python Fundamentals

### About Me
  I am a current WSU Tech student and I have worked with Python in the past as well as dabbled in C# in the past and prior to that did a fair amount of participating in Lego Mindstorms. Aside from that I am certified in Microsoft Word and have taken several classes that focused on webpage design.

This is the first programming language that we are going to work with in our Cloud Development Course.
